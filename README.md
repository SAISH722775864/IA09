This is a andorid PaintApp made for HCI CISC 682 Assignment IA09
The codes might show warnings but it works just fine :) 
to run this you need to download android studio and run it 
Then download the project from here and then open it in the android studio. 
The code might show a few warnings but nevertheless it runs properly when you start running. 
The app is a paint app where you get a canvas to paint on you have buttons to clear (this will clear the whole canvas and start a new one), 
Redo and Undo buttons for making changes to your drawing, there is a button named 'select color' which gives you the color options to draw with.
A seekbar is used to increase/decrease the brush size unlike before where buttons where used in IA08.
